# CS229 Project

Stanford CS 229 final project, Autumn 2020.
The project is broken down into two primary folders:

- `process_data` contains all of the code required to parse the personal
  financial disclosure data, preprocess the DIME and primary elections data,
  and merge all three together into the input data file used for analysis.

- `analyze_data` contains the Jupyter notebook file used to run the analysis
  and produce the final figures and results presented in the paper.
